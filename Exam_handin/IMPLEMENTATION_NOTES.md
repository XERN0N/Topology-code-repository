# Bowsprit Topology Optimization — Implementation Notes

## Problem Statement

2D plane-stress bowsprit spar, modelled as a rectangular cantilever.

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Length L | 3.80 m |
| Height H | 0.50 m |
| Thickness t | 0.05 m |
| F1 magnitude | 2 kN at 65° |
| F1 location | top edge, strip centered at 0.20 L, half-width 0.025 L |
| F2 magnitude | 3 kN at 55° |
| F2 location | top edge from 0.95 L to 1.00 L |
| Force direction | upper-left: `(-cos α, sin α)` for angle α from horizontal |
| Material | isotropic CFRP approximation |
| E₀ | 70 GPa |
| ν | 0.33 |

The left edge is fully clamped. F1 and F2 are converted from total force to surface traction by dividing by the strip area (`strip length × thickness`).

Tasks implemented:

- **Task 2**: FEniCS + pyadjoint + MMA topology optimization with robust double filtering
- **Task 3**: Three realizations, η ∈ {0.45, 0.50, 0.55} solved in parallel
- **Task 4**: Two realizations, η ∈ {0.45, 0.55}, with η = 0.50 evaluated afterwards
- **Task 5**: Compliance and volume comparison of the two approaches

## Mathematical Process

### 1. Design variable

The design variable ρ ∈ [0, 1] is defined element-wise on a DG0 function space (one DOF per mesh cell, constant inside each cell). It represents raw material density before filtering.

### 2. Helmholtz filter

The filter converts the raw density into a smooth field ρ̃ by solving the PDE

```
-r² ∇²ρ̃ + ρ̃ = ρ     on Ω
∂ρ̃/∂n = 0           on ∂Ω
```

where r is the filter radius. The weak form is

```
∫ r² ∇ρ̃ · ∇v dx + ∫ ρ̃ v dx = ∫ ρ v dx   ∀v
```

This is solved in a CG1 (P1, piecewise-linear) function space. Using DG0 here would make ∇ρ̃ = 0 inside each element, collapsing the diffusion term to zero and making the filter an identity. CG1 allows non-zero gradients across element boundaries.

The filter has the effect of spreading local density variations over a neighbourhood of radius r, removing checkerboard patterns and imposing a minimum feature size of approximately 2r.

### 3. Heaviside projection

The filtered field ρ̃ is projected to a physical density ρ̄ via the smooth Heaviside

```
ρ̄ = [tanh(β η) + tanh(β (ρ̃ − η))] / [tanh(β η) + tanh(β (1 − η))]
```

- β controls the sharpness of the transition. As β → ∞, the projection approaches a step function at ρ̃ = η.
- η is the threshold. Values of ρ̃ above η map to ρ̄ → 1 (solid); below η map to ρ̄ → 0 (void).
- The denominator normalises so that ρ̄(ρ̃=0) = 0 and ρ̄(ρ̃=1) = 1 hold at all β.

The result ρ̄ is projected back to the DG0 space.

### 4. Double-filter (robust formulation)

A single filter+project gives the **nominal** design. The robust formulation applies filter and projection twice:

```
ρ  →  filter(r₁)  →  project(β, η_min)  →  filter(r₂)  →  project(β, η_k)  →  ρ̄_k
```

- First filter+project (with η_min = min of all η values) creates a preliminary smoothed design.
- Second filter+project with the realization-specific η_k creates the final physical density ρ̄_k.

For Task 3, three realizations are produced:

| Realization | η_k | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| Dilated (d) | 0.45 | Features grow wider → more material |
| Nominal (i) | 0.50 | Balanced intermediate |
| Eroded (e) | 0.55 | Features shrink → less material |

For Task 4, only dilated (η=0.45) and eroded (η=0.55) are optimized. The nominal (η=0.50) is computed afterwards from the final design variables without re-optimization.

In both cases r₁ = r₂ = filter_radius = 0.04 m.

### 5. SIMP stiffness interpolation

The elasticity modulus of each element is interpolated using SIMP (Solid Isotropic Material with Penalization):

```
E(ρ̄) = E_min + ρ̄^p · (E₀ − E_min)
```

- p = 3 is the penalty exponent. It penalizes intermediate densities: a cell with ρ̄ = 0.5 contributes only 0.5³ = 12.5% of E₀ to stiffness, discouraging grey material.
- E_min = 10⁻⁶ · E₀ prevents a singular stiffness matrix in fully void regions.

### 6. Linear elasticity solve

For each realization k, the displacement u_k is found by solving the plane-stress linear elasticity problem

```
∫ σ(u_k) : ε(v) dx = ∫ T · v ds     ∀v ∈ V
```

where ε = ½(∇u + ∇uᵀ) is the small-strain tensor, σ = λ_eff tr(ε) I + 2μ ε is the Cauchy stress with **plane-stress** Lamé constants:

```
λ_eff = E ν / (1 − ν²)       (plane stress, NOT plane strain)
μ     = E / (2(1+ν))
```

(Plane strain would use λ = Eν / ((1+ν)(1−2ν)); plane stress replaces the denominator with (1−ν²).) T is the boundary traction from F1 and F2.

Boundary conditions: u = 0 on the clamped left edge.

Solver: MUMPS direct solver (reliable for ill-conditioned SIMP systems where E_min/E₀ = 10⁻⁶ causes condition numbers that defeat iterative solvers at high β).

### 7. Compliance objective

The structural compliance (external work) is

```
J_k(ρ) = ∫ T · u_k ds
```

This is the work done by the applied tractions. Minimizing compliance maximizes stiffness.

The combined objective across realizations is the sum:

```
J = Σ_k J_k(ρ)
```

### 8. Volume constraint

Standard unweighted volume fraction (applied to dilated realization):

```
V = ∫ ρ̄_d dx / (L · H) ≤ Vf
```

where Vf = 0.25.

### 9. Pitch constraint

A pitch-weighted volume constraint penalizes material far from the support, because pitching inertia scales with the square of distance from the clamped root:

```
V_pitch = ∫ w(x) ρ̄_d dx / ∫ w(x) dx ≤ Vf
w(x) = 1 + α (x/L)²,    α = 2.5
```

Both constraints use the dilated realization (most material), so satisfying them for the dilated design guarantees they hold for the nominal and eroded designs too.

### 10. Stress constraint (P-mean global aggregation)

A global P-mean stress constraint is added per realization, following Lecture 11 (slides 7, 9, 12) and Lecture 12 (slides 4, 5).

**Stress measure with ε-relaxation** (avoids singularity in void regions):

```
f_σ(ρ̄)  = ρ̄ / (ε(1−ρ̄) + ρ̄)          ε = 0.2 fixed
σ_vM²   = (3/2)(s_ij s_ij)_3D          full 3D deviatoric, corrected for plane stress
σ_min   = 1e-4 · σ_y                   floor preventing √0 in voids
σ_m(x)  = f_σ(ρ̄) · √(σ_vM² + σ_min²)
```

σ is computed with **base-material E** (not SIMP E), so the stress represents the solid-material stress, and f_σ accounts for interpolation. σ_vM uses the **corrected plane-stress formula**:

```
mean_stress = tr(σ) / 3 = (σ_11 + σ_22) / 3
s_2D = σ − mean_stress · I       (2D in-plane deviatoric)
s_33 = −mean_stress               (σ_33=0 in plane stress, but s_33≠0)
σ_vM² = 1.5 · (inner(s_2D, s_2D) + mean_stress²)
```

This gives σ_vM² = σ_11² + σ_22² − σ_11σ_22 + 3σ_12², the standard plane-stress formula.
(Using only `1.5·inner(s_2D, s_2D)` drops the s_33² term and underestimates σ_vM by up to ~15%.)

**P-mean global aggregation** (Lecture 12 slide 4):

```
σ_c^p = (1/|Ω|) ∫_Ω (σ_m / (α·σ_y))^p dΩ
constraint: σ_c^p − 1 ≤ 0   (equivalent to σ_c ≤ 1 for p>0)
```

Using σ_c^p instead of σ_c avoids the p-th root operation, keeping the pyadjoint tape simple.

**β cap** (Lecture 11 slide 9): β used for the stress rho_bar is capped at β_cap = β_lim/2 = 2R/l_e. Above this, the sharp Heaviside creates artificial stress concentrations at projection transitions. With R=0.04 m, l_e ≈ H/ny = 0.5/30 ≈ 0.017 m → β_cap ≈ 4.8.

**P-continuation**: p is raised per beta stage (e.g., 2→300 over 13 stages). At small p, σ_c^p averages the field and the constraint is loose but smooth. At large p, σ_c^p → max(σ_m/(α·σ_y)) and the constraint approaches a true maximum-stress constraint.

**p exponent as Constant**: `p` is wrapped in `fa.Constant(float(p))` so FEniCS JIT-compiles the form once (fixed structure) and only the constant value changes between stages. Using a plain Python int would create structurally distinct UFL forms for each p value, triggering re-compilation at every stage.

**Per-realization constraints**: one stress constraint per η realization (dilated, nominal, eroded). ncon increases from 2 to 2+len(eta_values).

### 11. Adjoint gradient computation

Gradients of J, V, P with respect to ρ are computed via pyadjoint. Each forward solve is recorded on a tape. A `ReducedFunctional` object then differentiates the tape in reverse (adjoint solve) to give dJ/dρ, dV/dρ, dP/dρ at the cost of one additional linear solve per functional. No hand-derived adjoint is needed.

### 11. MMA optimization

The Method of Moving Asymptotes (MMA, Svanberg 1987) is used to update ρ. MMA is a gradient-based optimizer that constructs a convex separable approximation of the objective and constraints at each iteration, then solves the subproblem analytically.

Settings: move limit 0.10, max 40 iterations per β stage.

### 12. Beta continuation

β is ramped through the schedule {1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256}. At each β, MMA is run to approximate convergence before β is doubled. This continuation strategy prevents the optimizer from getting stuck in a local minimum caused by the sharp Heaviside at large β, while still converging to a near-binary design at β = 256.

### Key adaptations from lecture code

**`parallel.py` DOF mapping bug fix**: `parallel.py`'s `create_mapping` uses `np.isin(coor_all, coor_group)` which returns indices in `coor_all`'s sorted order rather than paired to `coor_group[i]`. When a world-comm mesh and a group-comm mesh partition cells differently, the local DOF orderings diverge, producing a scrambled density transfer. `_build_dof_mapping` replaces this with a `scipy.spatial.cKDTree` nearest-neighbour lookup, matching each group coordinate to its world counterpart by distance.

**CG1 filter space**: The lecture's `filter_and_project.py` uses DG0 for both the design variable and filter intermediates. DG0 functions have zero gradient inside each element, so the diffusion term `r²⟨∇ρ̃,∇v⟩·dx = 0` and the filter reduces to an identity. `FilterAndProject` here uses a separate CG1 (`Vf`) space for filter trial/test functions and output, while keeping DG0 (`Vd`) for the design variable and projected result.

**MUMPS elasticity solver**: The lecture's `force_inverter.py` uses gmres + hypre_amg. For SIMP with E_min/E₀ = 10⁻⁶ and many void cells, the stiffness matrix becomes severely ill-conditioned at large β, causing gmres to diverge with `DIVERGED_ITS`. Switching to MUMPS (a direct solver) eliminates this.

## Parallel Execution

`Parallel` splits `MPI.comm_world` into N groups by assigning rank r to group `r % N`. Each group runs its FEM solve simultaneously:

```
World ranks:  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11
Task 3 (N=3): 0  1  2  0  1  2  0  1  2  0   1   2   ← group index
Group 0 (η=0.45): ranks {0,3,6, 9}  → dilated solve
Group 1 (η=0.50): ranks {1,4,7,10}  → nominal solve
Group 2 (η=0.55): ranks {2,5,8,11}  → eroded solve
```

**Gradient gathering** (`vgroup2global`):

1. Each group computes dJ_k/dρ on its group communicator.
2. `vgroup2global` gathers all group gradients to all world ranks, indexed by global DOF.
3. `g(x)` sums across groups: `dJ/dρ = Σ_k dJ_k/dρ`.
4. Volume and pitch constraint gradients come only from group 0 (dilated realization).

**Scalar gathering** (`sgroup2global`):

Each group computes its scalar (J_k, V_k, or P_k) and `sgroup2global` returns the vector [J_0, J_1, ...] to all ranks. The master assembles `J = Σ J_k`, `V = V_0`, `P = P_0`.

## Running

```bash
cd Exam_handin
mpiexec -n 12 --use-hwthread-cpus python bowsprit_topopt.py
```

`--use-hwthread-cpus` tells OpenMPI to count hardware threads (16 on 4800H) instead of physical cores (8). Without it, `mpiexec -n 12` may fail with "not enough slots".

Recommended process counts on Ryzen 7 4800H (8 cores / 16 threads):

| Task | Groups | Processes | Cores per group |
|---|---|---|---|
| Task 3 (3 η values) | 3 | 12 | 4 |
| Task 4 (2 η values) | 2 | 12 | 6 |

12 = LCM(3, 2) × 4, so both tasks divide evenly with no idle processes.

For maximum threads per task (run separately):

```bash
mpiexec -n 15 --use-hwthread-cpus python bowsprit_topopt.py   # task 3: 3 × 5
mpiexec -n 16 --use-hwthread-cpus python bowsprit_topopt.py   # task 4: 2 × 8
```

Control history stride (default 10 iterations between saves):

```bash
export BOWSPRIT_HISTORY_STRIDE=20
```

Quick test with smaller mesh:

```python
settings = OptimizationSettings(mesh_size=(20, 10), beta_schedule=(1, 2), kmax=5)
```
